\section*{Abstract}

Proving lower bounds for algorithms on general models of computation is a central yet
largely unfulfilled goal in the field of computational complexity. 
However, for some restricted models of computation strong lower bounds are known.
A lower bound for a problem is said to be constructive if there is an efficient algorithm, 
known as a refuter, that produces inputs on which the algorithm fails. 
Recent results indicate that constructive lower bounds for restricted models are 
as difficult to obtain as some lower bounds for general models. 
The goal of this work is to explore the state of the art of the construction of refuters 
for problems with known lower bounds.
